# Capstone-Project
This project is a simple client for the [hacker news api](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). It is a native android app that
 started out as my [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801?v=ad1) android developer nanodegree capstone project.

It has evolved into a "[breakable toy](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys)". 
It's something I can use to play around with and experiment with different Android concepts and apis.
