1. Shared Element Transition Requirement:
    Animate the card in the story list into the card for the detail header?
    Or animate the title into the detail title

2. Location Requirement:
    Use the location entered by the user in the shared preference to create a geo fence,
    when the user enters that location, pop the notification reminding them to read whatever
    story they had saved for reading later.

3. Notification Requirement:
    If the notification preference is set then, pop a notification to the user containing the story
    title and story url. If they tap the notification take them to the story url.

4. Widget Requirement:
    create a widget that will load just the top five stories and display them in a list.
    Tapping them will take you to the detail activity
