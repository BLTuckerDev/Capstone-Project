Later:
widget taking you directly to story detail activity
shared element transitions
task stack builder for the read later activity
consider loading in every onResume call for story list? nothing will change if everything is still the same?

more tests
remove the google analytics stuff from the repo now that we've passed through udacity
pull to refresh comment list

!! downloader needs to emit comments more often, right now it only emits after it has downloaded every single comment available....
rebase this branch on top of master
Make detail fragment use a content observer that resets the loader whenever we see a change to the comments path.
plan on removing comment refs by being smart with story id
