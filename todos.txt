Make sure settings menu is available in all activities

Check for any save for later stories before sending the notification,
dont send if we dont have any to read

Notifications are popping every 5 minutes, adjust this, we only want
a notification when they arrive at their location

Later:
on first load, while we are syncing we just display the empty story view with no indication, that we are in fact syncing.
widget taking you directly to story detail activity
more subcomponents based on fragment/activity so we can inject loader managers
shared element transitions
better comment loading so that we can display the comment tree as its loaded, rather than all at once at the end.
task stack builder for the read later activity
take a closer look at my comment loader and additional method i may need to implement
get rid of global "current story"
consider loading in every onResume call for story list? nothing will change if everything is still the same? but we will cover all the bases for updating the user about fresher stories?
more tests
sync state observer
remove the google analytics stuff from the repo now that we've passed through udacity
pull to refresh comment list
