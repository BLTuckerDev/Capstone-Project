Make sure settings menu is available in all activities

Check for any save for later stories before sending the notification,
dont send if we dont have any to read

Notifications are popping every 5 minutes, adjust this, we only want
a notification when they arrive at their location

Later:
widget taking you directly to story detail activity
more subcomponents based on fragment/activity so we can inject loader managers
shared element transitions
better comment loading so that we can display the comment tree as its loaded, rather
than all at once at the end.
task stack builder for the read later activity
take a closer look at my loaders and additional method i may need to implement
get rid of global "current story"
