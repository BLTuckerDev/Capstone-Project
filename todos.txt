1. Shared Element Transition Requirement:
    Animate the card in the story list into the card for the detail header?
    Or animate the title into the detail title

5. Tablet mode requirement
    We will need to provide at least one alternate layout in our app to support tablets.

6. work on comment loading time for stories with lots of comments
    the selected story needs to be set immediately so we can show it, and then load comments
    in background. This is especially important now that we have a button for saving a story for later.

Later:
work on first app launch from cold and from install
widget taking you directly to story detail activity
more subcomponents based on fragment/activity so we can inject loader managers
