1. Shared Element Transition Requirement:
    Animate the card in the story list into the card for the detail header?
    Or animate the title into the detail title

2. Location Requirement:
    Use the location entered by the user in the shared preference to create a geo fence,
    when the user enters that location, pop the notification reminding them to read whatever
    story they had saved for reading later.

3. Notification Requirement:
    If the notification preference is set then, pop a notification to the user containing the story
    title and story url. If they tap the notification take them to the story url.

4. Widget Requirement:
    create a widget that will load just the top five stories and display them in a list.
    Tapping them will take you to the detail activity

5. Tablet mode requirement
    We will need to provide at least one alternate layout in our app to support tablets.

6. Read Later Feature
    This is related to our requirement to use location and notification, once we have set up a way
    of reminding people of stories they wanted to read later we will need an activity that the
    notification can send them to in order to read those stories. A simple list where each element
    opens the browser will suffice for now.




Later:
